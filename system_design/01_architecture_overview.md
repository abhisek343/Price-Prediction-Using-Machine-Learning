# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the Prices Predictor System architecture.

## Components

- **Data Ingestion:** Module responsible for reading raw data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Modules for handling missing values, feature engineering, etc.
- **Model Training:** Pipeline for training the machine learning model.
- **Model Deployment:** Pipeline for deploying the trained model.
- **Prediction Service:** Component for serving predictions.
- **User Interface:** Flask-based web application for user interaction.

## Data Flow

Raw data is ingested, processed, and used to train a model. The trained model is then deployed as a prediction service, which is consumed by the user interface.

## Diagrams

Refer to the diagrams directory for visual representations of the architecture and data flow.
