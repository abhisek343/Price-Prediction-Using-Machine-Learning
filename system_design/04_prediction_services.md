# Prediction Services

This document describes the prediction services component of the Prices Predictor System.

## Overview

The prediction service is responsible for serving predictions from the trained machine learning model. It receives new data as input and returns predicted prices.

## Implementation

-   The prediction service can be implemented as a REST API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
-   It should load the trained model and expose an endpoint for receiving prediction requests.
-   Input data should be validated and preprocessed before being fed to the model.
-   Predictions are returned in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

## Scaling

-   The prediction service can be scaled horizontally to handle increased request load.
-   Containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) can be used for managing and scaling the service.
